Static Keyword================
Static variable static method static constructor static


Static Variable ;

When a Varible is declared as static then a single copy of the varibale is crated and sharerd
among all objects at the clas level

If you want to acces then then do it with the help of class
name,they do not requre object for access;

Eg for a non static class Regualar class

 progaram obj = new Program();
   sout(obj.name);
   but for the static varible if your class name is program and;

   Program.staticvaible;


   Static method ;
   Access with the name of the class;
    can acess static and non static fields

  Static Modifer ensures implmention is the same accros all class instances



 Syntax ---- for a variable;
 public static int a = 5;
 for a static method =
 public static void manin(String[] args);

 public static void print()
 {

 }

 They are given Some Sceanario


 public static class a {

   Static a()
   {

   }
   if  your clas haave  both default and satic constructor then static will call first
   and after that default will get executed;
   but a static constructor is not allowed in java // but it is allowed in the c# csharp;


  Static Class;

  public static It is not allowed to create object of static class;
  outer class.staticclass  obj = new Outclaas.staticlass();
